## Backlog / TODO
- [ ] **Check the RAM** — `pixi run build` intermittently crashes `cc1plus` (suspected faulty RAM). Run `memtest86+` (several passes), reseat/replace DIMMs. Workaround for now: re-run the build a few times until it passes.
- [ ] **Bind the `build` task to an environment** — `build` sits in the top-level `[tasks]` with no
      `environment=`, so a bare `pixi run build` silently uses the `default` env and poisons the
      CMake caches with `envs/default` paths. `test` already uses the
      `[{task=..., environment="humble"}]` form. Binding `build` the same way would fix the footgun
      but pin the workspace to `humble`; decide how `jazzy` should be built first.
- [ ] **Make `libfranka` + `franka_robot_state_broadcaster` actually public** — moved to
      `DFKI-SAIROL` on GitHub 2026-08-27, but anonymous https is still denied, so they remain the
      only private deps and still gate *every* profile
      (`workspace.py repos --profile minimal --visibility private`). Flip visibility, then set
      `visibility: public` and switch their urls to https in `config/workspace.yaml`.
- [ ] **Switch public repos to `https://` in `config/workspace.yaml`** — 12 DFKI-SAIROL repos are
      already public but cloned over SSH, so outside contributors are blocked by transport, not
      permissions.
- [ ] **Remove `zed_rig_aggregator_node` from `franka_py`** — the launch references are gone from
      this repo, but the package itself still lives in `src/franka_py/zed_rig_aggregator_node`.
      That is the "embedded somewhere" case; deleting it is a change in the `franka_py` repo.
- [ ] **Check for duplicate package names** — the IAS `franka_robot_state_broadcaster` repo also
      ships `franka_ros2` and `franka_semantic_components` packages, which `franka_ros2` provides
      too. Verify colcon is picking the intended copy.
- [ ] Widen `rosdep install` from `src/franka_ros2` to all of `src/` (deliberately left alone
      during the manifest refactor to keep behaviour unchanged).
- [x] Add Kay's config file for some tresholds: https://github.com/pompetzki/pixi_franka_ros2/blob/6d56274990ca0692217adebcd117da310c9b7381/scripts/launch/main.launch.py 
- [x] joint trajectory controller interpolators (move Puze's code for linear and bspline interpolation)
- [x] Move robot related configs to franka_launch
- [x] Option for installing the grippers in src/ 
- [x] move msgs to the correct repo
- [x] custom to aggregator from franka_py
- [x] data_collection is a standalone package
- [x] remove franka_ui
- [x] place the link to the crisp documnetation in the top of our

#### pinocchio 4.0.0 broke the build (env drifted from the lock)
- **Problem:** `pixi run build` failed with `fatal error: pinocchio/spatial/se3.hpp: No such file or
  directory` in `franka_control_module`. pinocchio 4.0.0 reorganised the headers: `pinocchio/spatial/`
  now ships only `fwd.hpp`, and the old layout moved under `pinocchio/deprecated/pinocchio/`, which is
  not on the default include path. `crisp_controllers` includes `spatial/se3.hpp` and
  `spatial/explog.hpp` too, so this breaks the whole workspace, not one package.
- **Root cause:** *not* a bad re-solve. `pixi.lock` correctly pinned pinocchio **3.9.0** for the
  `humble` env all along; the on-disk `.pixi/envs/humble` had **drifted** to 4.0.0. The environment
  was out of sync with the lock file.
- **Solution:** `pixi install -e humble` re-syncs the env to the lock and restores 3.9.0 — that is
  what actually fixed the build. If a build was attempted against the drifted env, `pixi run clean`
  too, since the stale CMake caches are sticky. Separately, `pinocchio` was declared `"*"` in
  `pixi.toml`; it is now `">=3,<4"` so that a future `pixi update` cannot pull 4.x back in. That pin
  left `pixi.lock` byte-identical — it is a guard, not the fix. Drop it once the sources are ported
  to the 4.x header layout.

### 2026-08-27

#### `libfranka` + `franka_robot_state_broadcaster` moved to GitHub
- **Problem:** Both lived on IAS GitLab, and their urls were duplicated in two places -
  `config/workspace.yaml` *and* hardcoded in the bespoke `franka_ros2` block of `setup.sh`.
- **Solution:** Repointed to `git@github.com:DFKI-SAIROL/...`. The `franka_ros2` block now looks
  urls up from the manifest via a `spec_url` helper instead of hardcoding them, so the manifest is
  genuinely the only place a url appears. `sync_repo` and the nested-repo loop now compare each
  checkout's `origin` against the manifest and `git remote set-url` when they differ, and submodule
  mode runs `git submodule sync --recursive` - so a future move applies itself on the next
  `pixi run setup` rather than needing a manual fix on every machine.
- **Still private:** anonymous https is denied for both (verified against `crisp_py` as a public
  control), so `visibility` stays `private` in the manifest and no profile is credential-free yet.
- Note for the eventual submodule migration: `libfranka` tracks `main`, `franka_robot_state_broadcaster`
  tracks `master`.

### 2026-08-25

#### `franka_py` is a multi-package repo (corrects an earlier note)
- `franka_client`, `franka_meta_quest`, `zed_rig_aggregator_node`, `franka_control_module` and
  `franka_visualization` are **packages inside `franka_py`**, not separate repositories. So
  `pixi run teleop` and `pixi run client` were never broken, and the VR teleop is already public
  (`franka_py` is a public repo). `franka_meta_quest` was removed from the manifest accordingly.
- Consequence for the manifest: **groups cannot be finer-grained than repositories.** Teleop is not
  separately selectable, it arrives with `franka_py` in the `dfki-core` group.

#### Phase 2: src/ migrated to git submodules
- **Problem:** `src/` was gitignored plain clones, so every `pixi run setup` silently moved everyone
  to whatever was on the default branch, and there was no way to reproduce a known-good checkout.
- **Solution:** the 14 migratable repos are now submodules pinned at committed SHAs. Profile
  selection drives `submodule.active`, so a profile installs exactly its groups.
  `workspace.py verify-submodules` checks `.gitmodules` against the manifest for drift.
- **No migration script.** The conversion was one-shot and is materialised in the committed
  `.gitmodules` plus the `src/` gitlinks, so a clone is already migrated and `setup.sh` only ever
  runs the submodule path. The throwaway `scripts/migrate_to_submodules.sh` and the clone-mode
  fallback were removed rather than kept as dead code with a destructive entry point.
- **Not migrated:** the `franka_ros2` bundle (`franka_ros2`, `libfranka`,
  `franka_robot_state_broadcaster`). The setup deletes 49 tracked files from the upstream tree,
  which a submodule cannot represent; it stays a plain clone under `/src/franka_ros2/` (still
  gitignored) until the DFKI fork lands.
- **Behaviour change:** `pixi run setup` no longer pulls the latest commits - it checks out the
  pinned ones. Use `pixi run update-src` to move submodules to the tip of their tracked branch,
  then either commit that (a deliberate bump) or discard it.
- **Known gap:** narrowing a profile (e.g. `dfki` -> `minimal`) stops tracking the extra
  submodules but does not remove their working trees, so colcon still builds them. Needs
  `git submodule deinit` for the now-inactive paths if profile switching becomes a real workflow.


#### numpy conda/pypi pin conflict blocks `pixi shell -e humble`
- **Problem:** `numpy` was declared as a *pypi* dependency (`feature.extra.pypi-dependencies`), but
  conda packages (ros-humble-desktop, pinocchio, ...) pull numpy in too and the conda pin wins.
  The conda solve pinned `numpy==2.5.2`, which cannot satisfy `crisp-python`'s `numpy<=2.3`, so the
  environment failed to solve at all.
- **Solution:** Moved numpy to the conda side as `[feature.extra.dependencies] numpy = "<=2.3"`,
  matching crisp_py's bound so both solvers agree. `humble`/`jazzy` now resolve numpy 2.3.0;
  `humble-clean` keeps 2.5.2 (it has no crisp-python, so no conflict). Re-pin if crisp_py's numpy
  bound moves.

#### Install profiles: groups + profiles manifest
- **Problem:** `scripts/setup.sh` hardcoded ~16 `sync_repo` calls, so there was one install
  configuration for everyone. Which packages a gripper needed was encoded in a third place
  (`read_overrides.py:DYNAMIXEL_GRIPPER_TYPES`), separate from both the clone list and the runtime
  config.
- **Solution:** Added `config/workspace.yaml` (repos / groups / profiles / gripper_requirements)
  and `scripts/python/workspace.py` to resolve it. `setup.sh` now drives its clone loop from the
  manifest, remembers the profile in `git config --local workspace.profile`, validates the profile
  against `robot_overrides.yaml`, and preflights all URLs with `git ls-remote` before cloning
  anything. Dropped `needs_dynamixel` from `read_overrides.py` — that mapping now lives only in the
  manifest. Backend is still `git clone`; submodules are a later, separate step.

#### Visibility audit
- All DFKI-SAIROL package repos are already **public** except `bspline_controller`. `libfranka` and
  `franka_robot_state_broadcaster` (IAS GitLab) are the only private dependencies in the build path.

#### Dropped ZED aggregator and B-spline controller
- **Problem:** `zed_rig_aggregator_node` was launched from `run_robot.sh` (already commented out)
  but never cloned; `bspline_controller` was cloned but is too specific to support right now.
- **Solution:** Both removed from the workspace. `zed_rig_aggregator_node` stays private and should
  be migrated away from wherever it is still embedded. `bspline_controller` stays private and
  unsupported; `bspline_joint_controller` removed from the `arm_controller` options in
  `robot_overrides.yaml`.

### 2026-09-07
 - **Problem:** remove mock_components/GenericSystem which doesn't work with effort (crisp_controllers/src/cartesian_controller.cpp uses effort command interface to communicate with the robot)
 - **Solution:** add fake_effort_hardware to handle the effort command interface and simulate the bimanual platform together with the real meta quest: https://github.com/DFKI-SAIROL/fake_effort_hardware

### 2026-07-07

#### cleaning/repos
 - add franka_data_collection, franka_custom_msgs
 - clean franka_py

#### Add a condiition to see if the gripper is turned on
  - **Problem:** The gripper is turned on separately, therefore an user might not notice that it's not turned on while launching the whole setup.
  - **Solution** Before launching the whole setup, ping the grippers (if specified).

### 2026-06-23

#### Intermittent build failures (suspected faulty RAM)
- **Problem:** `pixi run build` randomly crashes compiling `crisp_controllers` with `cc1plus: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault`. It is non-deterministic (different files/passes on identical source), so it points to a hardware fault — likely bad RAM, not a code bug.
- **Solution:** No code fix — just re-run `pixi run build` a few times until it succeeds. The RAM should be checked (`memtest86+`, reseat/replace DIMMs) in the future. See backlog above.

#### Stable gripper device names
- **Problem:** The Robotis RH-P12-RN-A grippers enumerate as `/dev/ttyUSB<N>` in kernel order, so the number is not tied to a physical gripper — power-cycling or replugging can swap left/right and break the launch.
- **Solution:** Added udev rules in `src/franka_launch/udev/99-dynamixel.rules` that pin each FTDI adapter's serial to a fixed symlink (`/dev/dynamixel_left`, `/dev/dynamixel_right`). Documented the install steps in the README under Prerequisites (§1.1.3).
